        <h2>who am i?</h2>
        <p>
            a very loaded question, but i am a lot of things. i am a student, a hobbyist, a linux-user, a daughter, a dreamer, and many other adjectives. (or nouns..?) i'm easily burnt out and always seeking enrichment. i'm flowing and stuck at the same time. i'm my own author, writing to an audience of one and spare change. i'm myself, but i can't really give you an accurate idea of what 'myself' is, can i? the most i can do is put out a front of authored veracity, as if my innermost thoughts reflected full sentences and complete thoughts. i am a reflection of you, and i am something else entirely.
        </p>

        <h2>...why this?</h2>
        <p>
            this isn't the first iteration of my neocities, and it won't be the last either. i've gone through about five different layouts before settling on 'version one,' a dark-mode rounded-corners ambitious first attempt to make a pretty website. i'd say that it <em>was</em> pretty, but we all need a change of pace every now and then.
        </p>
        <p>
            i've never understood personal journals. they just seemed like yet another way to lie to myself instead of putting my true thoughts on paper. so, in a way, this is my 'journal' meant to look back on and hopefully see something alive. a treasure trove of memories crafted over the course of months and years to be able to show off and―potentially―feel proud.
