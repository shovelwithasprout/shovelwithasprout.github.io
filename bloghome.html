                <p>
                    i'm on vacation as i write this and some pretty silly stuff has happened. Usually i don't write in my blog unless i'm feeling sad, or i've made a realization, or whatever else, but right now i actually have something to talk about! so i don't have any excuses!

                    it's been a long while since i've updated my blog.. and really it's me to blame. it's been a bit of a bumpy couple weeks, but not for any reason in particular. all i have to say is that i'm here now.
