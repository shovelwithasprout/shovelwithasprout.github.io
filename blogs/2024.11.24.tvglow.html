        it's been a long while since i've updated my blog.. and really it's me to blame. it's been a bit of a bumpy couple weeks, but not for any reason in particular. all i have to say is that i'm here now. currently i write this in the basement of a friend's house. it is near midnight and some show is playing on the tv that i pay no mind to. once calm and comfortable a couch seems just slightly too mushy and the once background noise seems too loud for comfort. it's been months since i've cried real tears. and i've held it all in again.

        i have watched two movies tonight alone. first, being smile 2, good movie. second, i saw the tv glow, amazing movie. it's hard to love something when it's openly criticized, especially by somebody close to you. it is hard to put my feelings to words when they always slip away, but "i saw the tv glow" finally managed to catch it. this movie is perfect at specifically one thing in my eyes. bringing 'it' to light. my repressed feelings that stay hidden no matter how hard i try. i say the same thing again and again but it will only become more apparent as i bash it into the skull of anybody who reads. to the near 1000 viewers of this website, i urge you, with all of my might, to watch this movie. it could be alone, it could be with a loved one. i don't care. please.
