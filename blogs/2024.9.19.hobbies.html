                        hi hi hello hi!! if you like the way i write i have some big news. i got an ao3 account!!!! i'll link my account <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/shovelwithasprout" target="_parent">here</a> but i'm working on a mlm trans fic based on the book "hell followed with us" by andrew joseph white (great book you should read it). the first chapter's in its drafts but come back in a week and there it'll sit for me to expand upon. i've had this acc for about a week or two i just have been <em>desperately</em> searching for a fandom to write about. when i discovered (more like i listened to a reccomendation) benji and his tragic gay story i just couldn't resist falling in love.

                        almost like karma, starting up my hobby as a fanfic author does add yet another thing to my plate. and uhh i'm not proud to say that i was at <em>one</em> point going to audition for allstate choir, but i dropped out. i was absent so often that i was gone more than i was present, so i kind of needed to drop out anyway. it was fun but it sucked for like three reasons.

                        <li>getting up that early every day is exhausting. i had to get up at like 6 am and let me tell you i am <em>not</em> a morning person. </li>
                        <li>so i'm like kind of an inbetween of tenor/alto, but its really just a toss up of whether i want a better tone but i have to ghost half the notes (which means i just don't sing them), or i can sing alto which i can hit all of the notes, but i sometimes have issues with tension and tone. i'd rather sing alto but i was auditioning as tenor for allstate, yikes.</li>
                        <li>allstate rehearsal everyday is really hard on your voice, like it constantly felt like i was recovering from a cold or something. 2/10 not great.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        i like allstate, but this year just wasn't it for me. maybe i'll do band allstate next year. for now i'll just enjoy my newly gained hour of sleep in the mornings.

                        now for some rapid fire. first, i'm considering making my own font for this website so it's moreso like my own handwriting. second, i've got a sick ass homecoming dress + corset that im super excited to wear. maybe i'll upload a pic sometime???? third, that musical i'm in, "Between the Lines", it's soooooo good. some of those songs are bangers you just gotta search for them. so far my favorite is 'can't get them out' (may not be an exact title). also, i'm soon going to take a class for javascript (probably) and that means one thing this website probably needs. movement!!! i'll get around to it someday :).
