                        would it really be that surprising if i told you this was/is my biggest venture into programming i've ever done? probably not. what i have as of writing this is a static, barebones site with a limited amount of content and some basic theming. i am scared of iframes and javascript. what i really need help with is figuring out what i can add to this website to make it a larger project, as i can't just rehash the same 5 .html pages again and again. (which i kinda should considering how weirdly they're formatted) i need ideas, people! and erm i'm not the most creative person.

                        really, this is more of a 'call to action' than real blog post, if you are reading this please look at my <a href="https://shovelwithasprout.atabook.org/" target="_parent">guestbook</a> and suggest things that need changed, cool things to add, literally anything. i should respond relatively often and i really would appreciate it! goodbye once more as i will probably go work on something else, traveler. &lt;3 &lt;3
