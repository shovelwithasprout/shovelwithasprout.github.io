        <h2>welcome</h2>
        <p>
            hi, i'm ethan or shovelwithasprout (she/her). this website is a passion-project by an academic victim in iowa (i don't like it here). in here you'll find crazy things like long spouts against capitalism and love-letters to the perfect game franchise that is 'little nightmares'. be warned also if you can't deal with all lowercase text because i can't be bothered to do proper capitalization on a site meant to be my own.

        <p>
          i have my very own button (as of like idk a couple days ago) and if i find any websites i think you should check out then they'll definitely be right here. for now it's just me :)

          <h2>updates!!</h2>
          <h3>7/14/25 - we're on github !! and new music</h3>
          <p>
            i finally made the switch to github pages !!! yay !!!! this also means that i have less restrictions and can host audio here. i won't be figuring out persistent audio playback as that's above my paygrade, but it does mean i can suggest songs and provide an immediate way to listen to them ! someday i might switch back to neocities' hosting if i end up liking it more, but for now github fits my needs much better. toodles!
          </p>
          <h3>7/10/25 - more quality of life !!!!</h3>
          <p>
            i've tweaked some of my css and figured out how to get that sweet sweet transparency in an easy-on-the-eyes way. from now on, there will be transparency in any page that i enable it on (all of them hahaha). also, the little nightmares page has gotten a much-needed formatting, so now it should be <i>much</i> easier to read. margins have been increased from 5 to 20px for aesthetics, image filtering has been tweaked so nothing looks too blurry / pixelated.
          </p>
          <p>
            also i added another blog abt how my airbnb's basement got totally flooded (not really, but it still had a lot of water).
          </p>
          <h3>7/9/25 - splatoon page added</h3>
          <p>
            well well well... there's a new page and a new format for you to discover... this one is more similar to the rainworld page than the other pages - as in, new css and seperated design language - so it will not really be mobile friendly. maybe it will be, but idk.
          </p>
          <h3>6/5/25 - linux page updated</h3>
          <p>
            new-and-improved linux rice finally here on the linux page ! it's still a work in progress (as in i'm constantly finding things to improve) but if you want my dotfiles just leave a comment in my guestbook and i can send them right to you ! &lt;3
          </p>
          <h3>4/26/25 - day 3 added</h3>
          <p>
            hey been a while! so i've been lowk procrastinating my rain world playthrough but in the meantime i've compiled day 3 onto the rainworld page. if you didn't realize i have to type out <i>everything</i> manually, so it's not super fun to do. i do think its worth it though to look back on and i need longer webpages so i can't really complain.
          </p>
          <h3>3/19/25 - first short prose added</h3>
          <p>
            i took my time while i could gain the motivation to write something, and then one night, i used the emotions i was feeling to write a poem about how i felt like my insides were rotten. it's in the prose section now, enjoy!
          </p>
          <h3>2/19/25 - prose page added</h3>
          <p>
            a new page has been added, plus the very first prose entry. this is going to be a new format (pretty similar to blogs but kind of not) which will allow me to share my writing projects and ideas without needing to contaminate my regular blogs and updates. there were a couple other tweaks around the website (the container is 100px wider now, among other things), but i forgot what i've done so far already. hahah.....
          </p>
          <h3>2/19/25 (midnight) - mood change!</h3>
          <p>
            if you had seen my website before and after this change, it would've looked dramatically different. i got bored of the samey aesthetic that came with my system, and i <em>almost</em> rewrote my website again but i decided against it and instead replaced the font, border radius, and colors of (mostly) every page. i'm glad it wasn't too hard to figure out because otherwise i guess i'd be writing more html right now. also, there's about a 50% chance that the website history page is finally up once i release this change. also, since the last update, i've added a (very figurative) blog to the blogs, marking the first one in ~3 months. thank you thank you i'll be here all night.
          </p>
          <h3>2/13/25 - qol blog page change</h3>
          <p>
            (the date is the same as last update but it's because the last update was at like 1 am) i fear my life here is just never-ending fixes to improve smaller and smaller things. this one was pretty big though. blogs can now be clicked from anywhere inside their box, and they also look cooler imo. you can go check it out if you want!
          </p>
          <h3>2/13/25 - little nightmares page complete!!</h3>
          <p>
            wooooooo!!!! i added completely new content!!!!! crazy that i'm back to doing this after all this time but huzzah!!! i <em>did</em> forget to give a date for the last update hahah.... but i'll do them from now on. you may have also noticed but i have slightly edited the colors to make things better on the eyes. this is partially because i now have color variables so theming will be MUCH easier now. maybe i'll write another blog post soon... we'll see. i also want to push the website history page somewhat soon.
          </p>
          <h3>2/5/25 - fresh coat of paint!</h3>
          <p>
            i came back after quite a while of being too exhausted to make changes or improvements to the website, but i'm back now! (for probably not very long tbh) as you probably noticed if you've been here before, i like completely redid the css and most of the html. however, i <em>did</em> save a backup of the previous version of the website. i've already made the page for the website history showcase, but i haven't added the content for it as of writing this.
