        <h2>2/19/2025 - a lover's machine</h2>
        <p>
          a woman works tirelessly in her residence. there's a body made entirely of metal and mechanical just below her, roughly in the shape of another woman. the human's forehead is slightly beaded with sweat, and a single droplet splashes upon the intricate surface of the metal face of the thing below the human. or, rather, not a thing. a being. one that hasn't yet awoken, but when it one day does, is cursed to fall in love with her creator. and its creator is doomed to crush on her most beloved creation.

          the idea came to me during class, but i would super super love to write a wlw story about a woman creating a very advanced robot, and falling in love with it. it has to check all of the boxes for me: slow burn, tragedy, and (well you'll never guess this one) queer joy. my favorite things to read. if this book was released by somebody else i'd want it to make me cry from joy and sadness. i'm serious. maybe i'll come back to this idea and <em>really</em> expand upon it, because i've always wanted to write and finish a novel.
