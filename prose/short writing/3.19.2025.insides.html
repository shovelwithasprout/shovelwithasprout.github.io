        <h2>3/19/2025 - i can feel my insides rotting</h2>
        <p>
          i can feel my insides rotting<br>
          my face is withering and i can't stop it<br>
          or rather<br>
          i won't<br>
          i've accepted my fate<br>
          and it was of my own choosing.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          my intestines churn and<br>
          my stomach rumbles,<br>
          my fingernails lengthen<br>
          as my ribs weaken<br>
          my thumbs have turned grey and<br>
          my face remains the same.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          a tremble, steady<br>
          as they go in a time long away<br>
          my hands push up, up, up<br>
          they caress my cheek,<br>
          my nose,<br>
          my chin,<br>
          and they return with the scent<br>
          and feel<br>
          and look<br>
          of rot.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          i can feel my insides rotting<br>
          but i do not see it<br>
          i am not ill, yet<br>
          this body is a prison and i must be let free.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          my visage is a commercial<br>
          eternally playing<br>
          the television is not plugged in and<br>
          the cord is wrapped around my wrists<br>
          the wrists of a person,<br>
          or maybe not even,<br>
          of some thing with my senses<br>
          but not my feel.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          my insides have rotted<br>
          surely they must have<br>
          because how else could i explain<br>
          the pit in my stomach when<br>
          she looks in my eyes,<br>
          her eyes because they can't be mine<br>
          her insides decorate my peripheral vision and<br>
          the truth becomes clearer than the liquids that seep<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          my insides are rotting, have rotted, are rot<br>
          i feel them<br>
          in<br>
          and out<br>
