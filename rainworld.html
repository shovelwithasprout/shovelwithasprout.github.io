      <p>
        rain world is the most unique game i've ever played. and i mean it. ask anybody who's played more than 2 hours
        how they feel about it and they'd all tell you the same thing; there is nothing quite like it. Of course, i
        wanted to document my journey playing this game. Here is my best recreation, an active playthrough, of the
        discord channel i am documenting my playthrough in. it may look raggedy as i am still figuring out the details on how
        to make it... function.

          dangnabbit okay....</p>
        <p>Gobbler[]
          any knowledge you gain is progress
          also rain world is nonlinear so there's not really an intended route <img src="assets/images/hunterglee.webp"

          ykw this is the perfect channel for me because i'm a chronic yapper
          i'm gonnna tell a little bit about my last runthrough before i continue with updates
          so basically
          i used quite a bit of help from wiki's and whatever i could get (besides walkthroughs except for that one part
          with hte running and hiding in tunnels part before i think the leg???) and that led me all the way to some sky
          garden area after five pebbles. i was trying to get back to somewhere and potentially beat the game although
          unlikely and i kept failing at this one really big jump. eventually i gave up because in my mind i had gotten
          myself softlocked, since trying to go the long way around (back down the leg, through everything) was super
          difficult i had given up. when i came back to the game i decided to just start anew and here i am!
          maybe this would be a great thing to make a blog abt on my webdsite
          also i'm trying to go to where mr. yellow is telling me, since i assume they are trying to lead me towards
          five pebbles, but they are really bad at giving instructions
          i'll update soonish once i give more routes a try</p>

          yeah i wish i hadn't so i could have the "true" experience but i was super cautious and only learned what
          somebody really observant would have learned by that point
          (i have terrible memory which is good for this specific reason)</p>

          okay i'm going to stop for hte night but i'm researching how i can have this as a blog without having to
          manually add profile pictures to every entry
          ew.... i need javascript to do what i was wanting to do
          should i do the harder, more customizable way of reformatting this all into my website page, or should i try
          to embed it? (if that's possible on a public server)
          nvm i'd have to manually do it
          okay! i can do it</p>

        overall this was just getting myself familiar with logging and asking for help. also with recording everything on this website. "Gobbler []", or now with the username "whiplash into a wall then jump", was and probably will be the main person helping me. other people jump in, but they don't end up staying for too long. whiplash, if you're reading this, i appreciate you!!

          okay so i've officially got everything on this channel until this point manually blogged! i may not blog this specific message bc its unimportant but any other messages i'm just copying the message / emojis / images and the username of the person who said it and kinda shuffling it onto my website,, here's the one time i'll mention it unwarranted and from now on i'll only talk abt it if somebody like actually asks me
          
          *edit for further clarification
          depending on my motivation i likely will not have this be up-to-date as manually doing every emoji and username and text takes a long time, surprising no one! it's more of a relic so i can look back and remember my run without relying on a discord channel being up

          help!!!! i'm trying to get on the right side of the wall in shoreline so i can go up (there's another route down below but its too far down in the water to be possible without help)

          you see that pipe to the right? Where does it go?

        <p>shovelwithasprout
          it goes down a screen, but i don't have a spear and that jump is tough to make
        </p>
        <p>Mottlepounce
          oh yeah... it's this room

        <p>shovelwithasprout
          do you want another screenshot of the room below or no

          nah. I figured out <img src="assets/images/hunterglee.webp" style="width: 22px">

          so... there's big body of water on the other route. Is there really no other way to cross it?
        </p>
        <p>shovelwithasprout
          is there a way to get more breath?
          otherwise i don't think so

        <p>Mottlepounce
          maybe you could see something to help you
        </p>
        <p>shovelwithasprout
          do the blue fruit / rocks / flowers help with breathing underwater?
        </p>
        <p>Mottlepounce
          I think you tried using them so you know the answer is no <img src="assets/images/monksilly.webp" style="width: 22px">
          is there anything else?

        <p>Mottlepounce
          there's a general advice applicable to every situation in the game: try grabbing, eating, throwing everything you see in that order <img src="assets/images/aninoto.webp" style="width: 22px;">

        <p>whiplash into a wall then jump
          do you want a direct answer to that because there's not really a way i could give an indirect answer <img src="assets/images/hunterkek.webp" style="width: 22px;">
        </p>
        <p>shovelwithasprout
          i do yes
          atp all i need to do to keep my rain world 'purity' is to not look at any spoiler channels or wiki
        </p>
        <p>whiplash into a wall then jump
          Correct !!! i think
          i had to check to make sure
        </p>
        <p>shovelwithasprout
          okay yeah then there must be some gate underneath moon's place?
          wait.
          oh no

        <p>shovelwithasprout
          i think shaded is after shore
          i say 'after' but i mean like the path i took last time
        </p>
        <p>whiplash into a wall then jump
          there's not really an order to the areas
        </p>
        <p>shovelwithasprout
          hmm i need to ponder this
          at the very least i can say that i've thoroughly explored shoreline

          I think if you wander around for long enough youll figure it out

          <img src="assets/images/pensive.svg" style="width: 22px;">i have finals week and isasp testing next week so i'll probably not be very active for a little bit
          i already am tired majority of the time so this does affect my free time
        </p>
        <p>Metalcat101 [equipment acquirer]
          lol me too

          so first of all i came back to shoreline and finally followed mr. yellow
          then that led me to shaded citadel
          terrifying i know BUT i didn't really end up interacting with the spider centipede things all that much
          kind of just trial and error but i had to like go through all of memory crypts and last stretch of sc in one cycle to get  past
          but afterwards
          um
          hold up i forgot what's after memory crypts
          OH wait is it exterior??
        </p>

        <p>shovelwithasprout
          so i worked my way through there with a grabby pill bug and a spear and rn i'm at the underhang
          my dilemma is that i have a very long journey and there's not a shelter that i'm aware of so i think i'll need to employ a lot of trial and error
        </p>
        <p>Gobbler []
          good luck <img src="assets/images/monksilly.webp" style="width: 22px;">
        </p>
        <p>shovelwithasprout

          maybe don't reveal creature names <img src="assets/images/rivflabbergasted.webp" style="width: 22px;">
        </p>
        <p>Doggo (ping reply)
          i didnt think it counted as a spoiler?
          they know what the creature is just not the name
          if someone called smth a “green reptile” referring to it as a green lizard isnt a spoiler if they've already seen it
          but alr i'll change

          Generally we want to use the same name as the owner of the thread.

          some popular names for things reveal their uses and also it's fun to see what names new players come up with <img src="assets/images/monksilly.webp" style="width: 22px">

          The bunker I think you are thinking of is a bit hard to find, if you want to know where it is just @ me or something <img src="assets/images/monksilly.webp" style="width: 22px;">

      <h2>taking a break from this game for a bit!</h2>
      <p>
        updating this page has definitely been annoying at the very least, and documenting even made rainworld feel like a job. (this happens to a lot of my hobbies which then burns me out, i'm not new to the concept) as a result, there's still more messages to be seen, yet i cannot bring myself to transcribe them. i urge you, if you want to see more, to either read the (little bit) left of my incomplete playthrough documentation, or play (buy or pirate idc) the original game and see everything for yourself. thank you to everybody who helped me and talked me through the toughest parts of this game, and while i may never finish it, at least i can say that i wouldn't have gone nearly as far without the help of the community.
