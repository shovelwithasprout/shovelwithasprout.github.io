                  The tide represents something different for each species of our world. Inklings and Octolings alike may view it as dangerous territory, or as the lasting consequence of ancient mistake.

                <p>
                  There is one particular species that seems to thrive in this environment, one of only a few. Researchers have labeled them as "Salmonids", potentially because of their ancestry from ancient "Salmon", as historical documents have noted. These Salmonids come in a range of shapes and sizes, but there is one feature about them that has led Grizz Co. to use them for massive profit.

                  The larger salmonids, when splatted, leave three "Power Eggs" in their place. These eggs have some interesting properties, hence the name. When broken and mushed into one sludge, the resulting product can be injected into tubes for a disposable, eco-friendly version of a glowstick. The glow only lasts for a good 12 hours before laying dormant, but it can be reactivated with the zap of a "Zapfish" or other means of electricity.

                <p>
                  According to several anonymous sources, there are rumors and witnesses that believe Mr. Grizz, the owner of Grizz Co., is using the power eggs with ill intention. While not all of them were sure exactly what he hypothetically plans to do, one of the sources told of a mysterious "goop" being manufactured*. They went on to explain how this substance has the ability to transform any inkling, octoling, or otherwise into a mammal. This is particularly note-worthy as mammals (except for Mr. Grizz and the Judds, of course) are entirely extinct.
