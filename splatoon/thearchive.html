                  Since the "Return of the Mammalions" there's been some reconstruction and an influx of new information. While this used to be a source of data from before the crash, this archive will now support more recent events and characters.

                  Of course, this doesn't mean that the archive is completely up-to-date. Files are corrupted, missing, or even completely absent. I promise, as soon as I am able, I will release the uncorrupted versions of each file. In the meantime, please remain patient.

                  I have uncovered my first document! It seems to be researching the "Salmonids" and their "Power Eggs". I have granted access to it via the file discovery. Unfortunately, only the first part of the file seems to be in order. I will need to work harder to decrypt and fix the rest of this file.
