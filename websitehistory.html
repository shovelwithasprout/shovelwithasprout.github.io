        <p>
            honestly idk if it shows but i am not that great at making websites... heh.... i know my way around some basic html and css but javascript scares me. what you're gonna see is a bit over 6 months of history (counted from the first to most recent blog) recollected in one page.
        </p>
        <h2>the first* design</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/ver1-1.png" style="width: 80%; display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-bottom:5px;">
        <img src="assets/images/ver1-2.png" style="width: 80%;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-bottom: 5px;">
        <img src="assets/images/ver1-3.png" style="width: 80%;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
        <p>
          this design lasted the longest, it was the first design i came up with that i liked, and it also happens to be the first design that i backed up in its entirety. it's pretty, but also pretty minimal, which is why i ended up wanting a change of pace. it also had a lot of little inconsistencies in how html files were formatted, some tabs were ignored, the use of iframes all on one website limited its flexibility, the font was just a little bit questionable, etc. of course up until pretty recently i still used that font, but i still think it deserves being called out. honestly, despite its imperfections, it still has a lot of charm to me and i'll always remember it as the first time i could settle and be proud of a website. oh god, the amount of tutorials i looked up (mostly w3 let's just be honest here) to make this layout was insane. i didn't touch css for a while after making this theme, until i needed to make a website for a shortfilm i was a part of (i'm not going to show you haha).
        </p>
        <h2>version two</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/ver2-1.png" style="width: 80%; display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-bottom:5px;">
        <p>
          alright, so, version two was the first ground-up rewrite i did for this website. i pretty much scrapped every page (except for the blogs of course, those i only edited to fit my new html conventions) to make it work how i wanted, and it was the shortest lasting one. as of writing this, i literally just heavily modified it in exchange for better colors and whatnot. this theme was super super minimal, almost too minimal for my taste, almost too boring. of course i would never have such a thing on this blessed website, but it was close. my favorite part about this layout is definitely the navbar, it's so simple yet it's all you realistically should want from a navbar. the font did persist from the last layout, partially (okay maybe completely) because i couldn't be bothered with switching fonts to a more readable one that fit the website's new aesthetic and appeal.
        </p>
        <h2>present day (as of july 10th, 2025)</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/ver3-1.png" style="width: 80%; display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;margin-bottom:5px;">
        <p>
          naturally, this page will evolve as my website does, until its longer than any other page on this website. i'm very indecisive, so a lot of changes happen here when i'm feeling productive and motivated.
